Problem Statement:

You will be given a news article. Your task is to determine the sentiment of the article, specifically towards the future stock value of any mentioned company.

Steps:
1. Read the article and analyze the sentiment it expresses.
2. Write out your symbolic reasoning for the sentiment analysis.
3. Output a numeric sentiment score between -1.0 and 1.0:
   - -1.0: Most negative
   - 0: Neutral
   - 1.0: Most positive
   - 0.0: If no conclusion can be drawn
4. Provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, indicating your confidence in the sentiment analysis.

Constraints:
- Adhere strictly to the facts in the article.
- Avoid unsupported logical leaps or assumptions.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:
```
The latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation slowed in April as prices increased in line with Wall Street expectations.

The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2% in April, in line with Wall Street's expectations but slower than the 0.3% increase seen in March.


Core PCE was up 2.8% over the prior year in April, in line with estimates and unchanged from the annual increase seen in the last two months. April's reading marked the slowest month-over-month increase for the index of 2024.

Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce noted the cooling in month-over-month increases "represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter."

    "reasoning": "Let's start by symbolically analyzing the given text to determine the sentiment towards the potential future stock value of any mentioned company.\n\n### Step-by-Step Symbolic Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Key Statements and Facts:**\n   - The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.2% in April, in line with Wall Street's expectations, but slower than the 0.3% increase in March.\n   - Core PCE was up 2.8% over the prior year in April, unchanged from the previous two months.\n   - April's reading marked the slowest month-over-month increase for the index in 2024.\n   - Michael Pearce, Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist, stated that the cooling in month-over-month increases \"represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter.\"\n\n2. **Determine Sentiment Towards Inflation:**\n   - Slower inflation increases are seen as positive by economist Michael Pearce.\n   - Meeting Wall Street's expectations suggests no negative surprises, which is neutral to positive.\n\n3. **Impact on Stock Values:**\n   - Positive sentiment towards inflation cooling down generally implies potential positive sentiment towards stock values, as lower inflation can lead to lower interest rates, boosting stock market performance.\n   - The consistency with Wall Street's expectations means stability, which can be perceived positively for stock values.\n\n### Symbolic Logic Representation\n\n```prolog\n% Facts\ninflation_april(core_pce, 0.2).\ninflation_march(core_pce, 0.3).\ninflation_annual(core_pce, 2.8).\n\n% Statements from experts\nstatement(michael_pearce, \"cooling in month-over-month increases represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter\").\n\n% Reasoning\nsentiment_towards_inflation(michael_pearce, positive).\ninflation_meets_expectations(wall_street, true).\n\n% Inference rules\npositive_inflation_news -> positive_stock_sentiment.\nmeeting_expectations -> neutral_or_positive_stock_sentiment.\n\n% Sentiment towards stock value\nstock_sentiment(positive) :- positive_inflation_news, meeting_expectations.\n```\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1. Restate the problem:\n   - Determine the sentiment of the news article towards the future stock value based on the provided data and expert opinion.\n\n2. Formulate the plan:\n   - Analyze the provided facts and statements.\n   - Identify the sentiment towards inflation and expectations.\n   - Infer the sentiment towards future stock values based on the sentiment towards inflation and meeting expectations.\n\n3. Execute the plan:\n   - Use symbolic logic to derive the sentiment.\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure the derived sentiment accurately reflects the given information without unsupported assumptions.\n\n### Execution and Solution\n\n1. **Analysis:**\n   - The news article states that inflation slowed in April.\n   - Michael Pearce interprets this as positive news on inflation.\n   - The data met Wall Street's expectations.\n\n2. **Symbolic Logic Execution:**\n   ```prolog\n   positive_inflation_news = true.\n   meeting_expectations = true.\n\n   stock_sentiment(positive).\n   ```\n\n3. **Numeric Sentiment Score:**\n   - Since both indicators (positive news on inflation and meeting expectations) point towards a positive sentiment, we assign a positive sentiment score.\n   - Considering the context and the absence of any negative indicators, a reasonable sentiment score would be 0.7.\n\n4. **Confidence Score:**\n   - The confidence in this analysis is high because both key indicators align positively.\n   - Assign a confidence score of 0.9.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```prolog\n% Sentiment Score\nsentiment_score(0.7).\n\n% Confidence Score\nconfidence_score(0.9).\n```\n\n**Sentiment Score: 0.7**  \n**Confidence Score: 0.9**\n\nThis concludes the symbolic chain of thought reasoning for determining the sentiment of the provided article.",
    "conclusion": "The sentiment of the news article regarding the potential future stock value is generally positive. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index showed a slower increase in April, which met Wall Street's expectations and was perceived as good news for inflation by Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce. This cooling in inflation is seen as a positive indicator for the stock market, suggesting potential stability and growth.",

Example 2:

Input:
```
The Fed's stance of holding interest rates higher for longer likely won't be shaken after a fresh reading from the central bank's favored inflation gauge showed continued stickiness of prices.

The so-called "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control, clocked in at 2.8% over the prior year in April. That annual increase was unchanged from March and in line with expectations.

But the month-over-month increase in April showed a sliver of progress, clocking in at 0.2%. That was a tenth of a percent lower than the level for March and represented the slowest such increase for the index so far in 2024.

"What we ended up getting was a mix," Ryan Wang, HSBC US economist, said on Yahoo Finance Live.

The Fed "will be happy" with the month-over-month easing but the flat year-over-year figure "really doesn’t indicate much progress on disinflation this year."

Thus the new inflation reading isn't likely to alter the caution expressed by numerous Fed officials in the weeks since the last Fed meeting on May 1.

Cuts will happen "at some point," New York Fed president John Williams said Thursday. But "I don’t feel any urgency."

What's more, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has made clear that he thinks the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward the central bank's goal of 2%.
