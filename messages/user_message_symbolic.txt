Problem Statement:

You will be provided with a news article.  The problem is that we need to figure out the accurate sentiment of the article.

Carefully read the article and analyze the sentiment it expresses.

First, write out your symbolic reasoning of analysis of the article's sentiment.

Then, output a numeric score between -1.0 and 1.0 representing the sentiment, where -1.0 is the most negative, 0 is neutral, and 1.0 is the most positive. If no conclusion can be drawn, provide a sentiment value of 0.0.

Additionally, provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0, representing how confident you are in the sentiment analysis. A higher score indicates greater confidence.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:

```
The latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation slowed in April as prices increased in line with Wall Street expectations.

The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out the cost of food and energy and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2% in April, in line with Wall Street's expectations but slower than the 0.3% increase seen in March.


Core PCE was up 2.8% over the prior year in April, in line with estimates and unchanged from the annual increase seen in the last two months. April's reading marked the slowest month-over-month increase for the index of 2024.

Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce noted the cooling in month-over-month increases "represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter."

    "reasoning": "Let's start by symbolically analyzing the given news article to determine the sentiment towards the potential future stock value of any mentioned company.\n\n### Step-by-Step Symbolic Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify Key Statements and Facts:**\n   - The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.2% in April, in line with Wall Street's expectations, but slower than the 0.3% increase in March.\n   - Core PCE was up 2.8% over the prior year in April, unchanged from the previous two months.\n   - April's reading marked the slowest month-over-month increase for the index in 2024.\n   - Michael Pearce, Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist, stated that the cooling in month-over-month increases \"represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter.\"\n\n2. **Determine Sentiment Towards Inflation:**\n   - Slower inflation increases are seen as positive by economist Michael Pearce.\n   - Meeting Wall Street's expectations suggests no negative surprises, which is neutral to positive.\n\n3. **Impact on Stock Values:**\n   - Positive sentiment towards inflation cooling down generally implies potential positive sentiment towards stock values, as lower inflation can lead to lower interest rates, boosting stock market performance.\n   - The consistency with Wall Street's expectations means stability, which can be perceived positively for stock values.\n\n### Symbolic Logic Representation\n\n```prolog\n% Facts\ninflation_april(core_pce, 0.2).\ninflation_march(core_pce, 0.3).\ninflation_annual(core_pce, 2.8).\n\n% Statements from experts\nstatement(michael_pearce, \"cooling in month-over-month increases represents better news on inflation than we saw in the first quarter\").\n\n% Reasoning\nsentiment_towards_inflation(michael_pearce, positive).\ninflation_meets_expectations(wall_street, true).\n\n% Inference rules\npositive_inflation_news -> positive_stock_sentiment.\nmeeting_expectations -> neutral_or_positive_stock_sentiment.\n\n% Sentiment towards stock value\nstock_sentiment(positive) :- positive_inflation_news, meeting_expectations.\n```\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1. Restate the problem:\n   - Determine the sentiment of the news article towards the future stock value based on the provided data and expert opinion.\n\n2. Formulate the plan:\n   - Analyze the provided facts and statements.\n   - Identify the sentiment towards inflation and expectations.\n   - Infer the sentiment towards future stock values based on the sentiment towards inflation and meeting expectations.\n\n3. Execute the plan:\n   - Use symbolic logic to derive the sentiment.\n\n4. Verify the solution:\n   - Ensure the derived sentiment accurately reflects the given information without unsupported assumptions.\n\n### Execution and Solution\n\n1. **Analysis:**\n   - The news article states that inflation slowed in April.\n   - Michael Pearce interprets this as positive news on inflation.\n   - The data met Wall Street's expectations.\n\n2. **Symbolic Logic Execution:**\n   ```prolog\n   positive_inflation_news = true.\n   meeting_expectations = true.\n\n   stock_sentiment(positive).\n   ```\n\n3. **Numeric Sentiment Score:**\n   - Since both indicators (positive news on inflation and meeting expectations) point towards a positive sentiment, we assign a positive sentiment score.\n   - Considering the context and the absence of any negative indicators, a reasonable sentiment score would be 0.7.\n\n4. **Confidence Score:**\n   - The confidence in this analysis is high because both key indicators align positively.\n   - Assign a confidence score of 0.9.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```prolog\n% Sentiment Score\nsentiment_score(0.7).\n\n% Confidence Score\nconfidence_score(0.9).\n```\n\n**Sentiment Score: 0.7**  \n**Confidence Score: 0.9**\n\nThis concludes the symbolic chain of thought reasoning for determining the sentiment of the provided article.",

Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, have been on a bumpy ride after Trump was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records intended to influence the 2016 presidential campaign.

Shares initially fell (then climbed back) in extended hours trading post-conviction but the stock has since dropped again, down about 6% shortly after the opening bell.

Trump, who will likely appeal the verdict, will be sentenced on July 11 and faces up to four years in prison on each count.

Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.

Shares have fallen about 10% since the company's public debut at the end of March.

Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms, although the former president almost exclusively posted on his Truth Social account throughout the trial.

Example 3:


Input:

The Fed's stance of holding interest rates higher for longer likely won't be shaken after a fresh reading from the central bank's favored inflation gauge showed continued stickiness of prices.

The so-called "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices the Fed can’t control, clocked in at 2.8% over the prior year in April. That annual increase was unchanged from March and in line with expectations.

But the month-over-month increase in April showed a sliver of progress, clocking in at 0.2%. That was a tenth of a percent lower than the level for March and represented the slowest such increase for the index so far in 2024.

"What we ended up getting was a mix," Ryan Wang, HSBC US economist, said on Yahoo Finance Live.

The Fed "will be happy" with the month-over-month easing but the flat year-over-year figure "really doesn’t indicate much progress on disinflation this year."

Thus the new inflation reading isn't likely to alter the caution expressed by numerous Fed officials in the weeks since the last Fed meeting on May 1.

Cuts will happen "at some point," New York Fed president John Williams said Thursday. But "I don’t feel any urgency."

What's more, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has made clear that he thinks the Fed will need more than a quarter's worth of data to make a judgment on whether inflation is steadily falling toward the central bank's goal of 2%.
