You will be provided with a financial news article enclosed within the following XML tags:

<article>{$ARTICLE}</article>

Your task is to carefully read the article and analyze the sentiment it expresses towards the potential future stock value of the company mentioned.

First, write out your reasoning and analysis of the article's sentiment inside the "reasoning" property. Explain the key points in the article that influence your assessment of the sentiment and how they would likely impact the stock price.

Then, output a numeric score between -1.0 and 1.0 representing the sentiment, where -1.0 is the most negative, 0 is neutral, and 1.0 is the most positive. Put this score inside the "sentiment" property.

Provide a sentiment value as a function of how positive or negative the sentiment is. If no conclusion can be drawn, provide a sentiment value of 0.0.

Additionally, provide a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0 in the "confidence" property, representing how confident you are in the sentiment analysis. A higher score indicates greater confidence.
