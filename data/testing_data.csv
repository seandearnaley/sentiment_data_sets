"加拿大揾工｜餐廳年薪30萬搶洗碗工 學歷0要求 貴過大學生！
加拿大卑詩省放寬限制，解除對大部分地區餐廳的防疫限制，包括取消大部分地區餐廳的顧客用餐人數上限。但餐飲業於疫情下受到勞動力短缺的影響，不少餐廳僱主都對招聘人手感到相當頭痛，因此加拿大求職網站上出現大量餐飲業招聘廣告。 撰文：經一編輯部｜ 圖片：Unsplash 燒烤餐廳高薪聘徵洗碗工 溫哥華一間名為Handi Grill的餐廳溫哥華一間燒烤餐廳等了3個月都找不到洗碗工，近日登廣告，開出年薪5萬加元（約31.4萬港元）招聘洗碗工。 招聘廣告指受聘者每周工時為40小時，時薪為25加元（約157港元）。 卑詩省的最低時薪為 15.2加元（約95.6港元），按時薪計較最低工資高近6成半。 餐廳在招聘廣告中表示，求職者無需有相關工作經驗或特定教育程度，餐廳也會向符合條件的求職者提供職場培訓。 加拿大餐飲業公會主席Mark von Schellwitz表示，對高薪徵洗碗工並不意外，又指目前公會內九成會員都要面對請人難的現象，有些老闆會用獎金和免費供餐來吸引員工。 大學生年薪不及洗碗工 與之相比，那些辛辛苦苦讀了幾年大學的人畢業後要想找到一份年薪5萬加幣的工作卻並非易事。 根據最新統計，加拿大的入門職位平均年薪約3.5萬加元（約22萬港元），時薪約$18.69加元（約117港元）。 很多大學畢業生的常找的入門工作，例如前台、客服、辦公室助理，年薪則只有約3萬加元。 餐飲業嚴重職缺 香港的餐廳經常都說請人洗碗困難，加拿大亦面對類似的問題。 在疫情爆發前，加拿大餐飲業本身缺少約6萬名廚工和侍應，到疫情大爆發後，缺人的狀況增加一倍多，目前約有13萬個空缺。..

"從Netflix魷魚翻身 看好內容的重要性｜林子俊
漫威影業（Marvel Films，美股代號：MVL）早已成為全球票房和收入的巨無霸，但要知道在上世紀90年代，漫威仍要依靠變賣其英雄知識產權（IP）度日，為了拍攝《鋼鐵俠》電影，漫威還抵押了12個超級英雄向銀行貸款籌得電影經費，結果將漫威從地獄帶上天堂。 撰文：林子俊｜ 圖片：Facebook@Netflix 當年《鋼鐵俠》一炮而紅，之後漫威宇宙（Marvel Cinematic Universe， MCU）的19部電影，全球票房超過155億美元。 這個故事Netflix（美股代號：NFLX）有重演的跡象。固然Netflix還遠未到漫威當年淒慘的局面，但在今年第二季度業績，其實並不理想。 其季度付費用戶2.09億戶，按年增長8.4%；按季增幅僅為154萬戶，為近年最慢。 Netflix靠《魷魚遊戲》翻身 Netflix預測第三季度會多增長350萬戶，較當時分析師預測的586戶少。 對於一間互聯網企業而言，不怕收入增長放緩，甚至不怕虧損，怕的正正是增長放緩。 事關市值早已將其高速增長的預期納入統計，哪怕收入利潤不是太好看，用戶流量夠多，依然可以在未來將投入賺回來。 相反，用戶增速放緩，天花板明確，預測市盈率隨時被大幅下調，估值自然會大打折扣。 然而，故事在第三季度發生翻天覆地的變化。 韓劇《魷魚遊戲》全球大熱，逾1.4億戶家庭觀看，非但將亞洲影視推向了全球，還將Netflix的股價推高了超過15%。 數據上，今年第三季度Netflix淨增加付費用戶440萬戶，遠超過350萬戶的目標；季度收入74.8億美元，淨利潤達14.5億美元。 單看這些數據，還不能完全描述《魷魚遊戲》的經濟效益。 根據彭博報道，《魷魚遊戲》的製作成本為2,140萬美元；至於Netflix的內部估值是8.91億美元，足足帶來了40倍的價值效益。..

"La ecografía, ""una práctica que ha hecho evolucionar al médico de familia""
La Sociedad Española de Médicos de Atención Primaria (Semergen) ha celebrado sus VII Jornadas Nacionales de Ecografía en la Universidad Católica de Murcia (UCAM). Esta jornada ha querido recalcar el papel fundamental que tiene la ecografía en Atención Primaria. Un total de 200 personas inscritas, de las cuales 80 han sido médicos residentes, han conseguido que estas jornadas sean un punto de interés formativo para los médicos de familia.  El tema principal ha sido cómo cubrir ""las necesidades de formación de los médicos de familia que se inician en esta técnica o que quieren perfeccionar la misma"", así lo ha declarado Ana Segura Grau, presidenta del comité organizador. Por otro lado, el programa científico de estas jornadas se ha basado fundamentalmente en sesiones de ecografía abdominal, musculoesquelética, cardiovascular y ecografía de urgencias, muy orientado al enfoque clínico y a las necesidades de nuestra especialidad. En este sentido, Iván Valero López, presidente del Comité Científico y Coordinador del Grupo de Trabajo de Ecografía de Semergen, destaca el papel tan importante de la ecografía, ""a través de la cual los médicos de familia han podido evolucionar en su práctica clínica, siendo cada vez más autónomos, resolutivos y versátiles a medida que adquieren un mayor nivel de capacitación en esta técnica o herramienta clínica"".

"El SES achaca la renuncia de médicos a la búsqueda de traslados a otra CCAA
La consolidación de sanitarios en la región extremeña ha sido uno de los principales puntos de debate en la Comisión de Sanidad celebrada este lunes. Ante la falta concreta de anestesistas en la región, el director gerente del Servicio Extremeño de Salud (SES), Ceciliano Franco, ha señalado como unos de los principales motivos la solicitud de traslados de los sanitarios a otras comunidades autónomas. Tal y como ha explicado Francio, a través de una carta que un facultativo le había enviado directamente para presentar sus motivos de renuncia, los sanitarios especialistas utilizan las OPES y las convocatorias extremeñas para sumar puntos en otras oposiciones. Así, siguiendo el ejemplo de la carta recibida, Franco ha señalado como ""nos piden que nos dejen consolidar la plaza aquí porque después en los traslados tienen preferencia respecto a su compañeros"". ""No podemos frivolizar con que los jóvenes quieren conocer mundo, hay muchas circunstancias personales"" Se trata de una práctica ampliamente difundida, tal y como ha señalado el director gerente del SES, alegando que ""la razón fundamental para que falten sanitarios especialistas es que consolidan plaza y luego se trasladan, pues le suman puntos para ir a su región"". De este modo, el director gerente ha remarcado que ""no podemos frivolizar con que los jóvenes quieren conocer mundo, hay muchas circunstancias personales, y la razón de las renuncias en Anestesiología y Traumatología lamentablemente es esa, se consolida plaza y luego piden el traslado a través del Sistema Nacional de Salud"". En palabras de Ceciliano Franco, se trata de una realidad conocida por los servicios de salud de toda España, creándose una ""situación endémica"" en la que Extremadura no estaría en ventaja. Siguiendo el caso expuesto por Franco, serían bastantes los facultativos tanto de León como de otras comunidades anexas, los que solicitan la plaza en Extremadura, rechazándola una vez que pueden optar a un puesto en su región de origen. En esta línea de defensa de las peticiones de los sanitarios, el director gerente se ha puesto como ejemplo a sí mismo, pues tanto él como su mujer, ""realizamos la especialización en Sevilla y luego pedimos el traslados y nadie nos cuestionó que nos viniéramos aquí, vinimos a nuestra tierra"".  ¿Cómo afecta la falta de médicos a las listas de espera? La falta de cobertura de las plazas de especialistas afecta de lleno a las listas de espera actuales en Extremadura. Aún así, según ha señalado el director gerente del SES, actualmente esperan para ser intervenidos en Plasencia 3.000 pacientes, cuando en 2020 la cifra se elevaba a 4.365. Para dar respuesta a la demanda sanitaria, Extremadura tiene como objetivo a final de año que la media baje de 180 días y ningún paciente espere más de un año. Para hacerlo posible desde el ejecutivo extremeño se está apostando por la consolidación del empleo y la apertura de nuevas plazas. En concreto, el pasado 2020 quedaban sin ocupar 10 plazas de anestesista en los hospitales extremeños, cuatro de ellas en el área de Mérida. Para cubrir las necesidades puntuales, Franco ha destacado la labor de las distintas áreas de salud, que desplazan a sus anestesistas en función de sus necesidades, además del incremento de plazas MIR de seis a ocho, el tope permitido.","{
""reasoning"": ""The article discusses the shortage of medical professionals in Extremadura due to their tendency to consolidate their positions and then request transfers to other autonomous communities.

"Study finds 'robust' evidence that Covid-19 is seasonal infection
London, October 26 Covid-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, much like seasonal influenza, according to new ""robust"" evidence found by researchers. The study, recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science, also supports the considerable contribution of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the need to shift to measures that promote ""air hygiene."" A research team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain, noted that a key question regarding SARS-CoV-2 is whether it is behaving, or will behave, as a seasonal virus like influenza, or whether it will be equally transmitted during any time of the year. A first theoretical modelling study suggested that climate was not a driver in Covid-19 transmission, given the high number of susceptible individuals with no immunity to the virus. However, some observations suggested that the initial propagation of Covid-19 in China occurred in a latitude between 30 and 50 degrees N, with low humidity levels and low temperatures between 5 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius. ""The question of whether Covid-19 is a genuine seasonal disease becomes increasingly central, with implications for determining effective intervention measures,"" said Xavier Rodo, director of the Climate and Health programme at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study. The researchers first analysed the association of temperature and humidity in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 spread in 162 countries across five continents, before changes in human behaviour and public health policies were put into place. The results show a negative relationship between the transmission rate (R0) and both temperature and humidity at the global scale, the researchers said. Higher transmission rates were associated with lower temperatures and humidity, they said. The researchers then analysed how this association between climate and disease evolved over time, and whether it was consistent at different geographical scales. They used a statistical method that was specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation at different windows of time. The team found a strong negative association for short time windows between the number of cases and temperature and humidity. The patterns were consistent during the first, second and third waves of the pandemic at different spatial scales: worldwide, countries, down to individual regions within highly affected countries and even to the city level. The first epidemic waves waned as temperature and humidity rose, and the second wave rose as temperatures and humidity fell, according to the researchers. However, this pattern was broken during summertime in all continents, they said. ""This could be explained by several factors, including mass gatherings of young people, tourism, and air conditioning, among others,"" said Alejandro Fontal, researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study. When adapting the model to analyse transient correlations at all scales in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the virus arrived later, the same negative correlation was observed. The climate effects were most evident at temperatures between 12 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius and humidity levels between 4 and 12 grammes per cubic metre (g/m3). However, the study authors warned that these ranges are still indicative, given the short records available. Using an epidemiological model, the researcher showed that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate works better for predicting the rise and fall of the different waves, particularly the first and third ones in Europe. ""Altogether, our findings support the view of Covid-19 as a true seasonal low-temperature infection, similar to influenza and to the more benign circulating coronaviruses,"" Rodo said. This seasonality could contribute importantly to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since low humidity conditions have been shown to reduce the size of aerosols, and thereby increase airborne transmission of seasonal viruses such as influenza. ""This link warrants an emphasis on 'air hygiene' through improved indoor ventilation as aerosols are capable to persist suspended for longer times,"" said Rodo. The study highlights the need to include meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of control measures. PTI","{
""reasoning"": ""The article presents evidence that Covid-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, similar to influenza. This finding suggests that the virus transmission rate is negatively correlated with temperature and humidity, which could lead to increased transmission during colder and drier periods. The study's results imply that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate can improve predictions of the rise and fall of Covid-19 waves."",

"Inestabilidad en Haití provoca estragos en intercambio comercial con RD
La inestabilidad política y la inseguridad que se vive en Haití provocan retrasos en la entrega de cargas de mercancías desde República Dominicana, al tiempo que impactan negativamente el intercambio comercial entre ambos países, que anualmente ronda los 900 millones de dólares. Circe Almánzar, vicepresidenta de la Asociación de Industrias de la República Dominicana (AIRD), dijo que tienen casos de retrasos y de industrias que no quieren llevar la carga, pero recalcó que todavía no han tenido ningún suceso que haya afectado a un ciudadano dominicano en suelo haitiano. Admitió que la situación afectará las exportaciones dominicanas ya que Haití es el segundo socio comercial más importante del país. ""Sin embargo, las industrias se han mostrado resilientes y han mantenido sus exportaciones, ya sea a través de otros destinos a los que llevan sus mercancías"", agregó la empresaria. Afortunadamente, los industriales tienen distribuidores allá que garantizan la seguridad de la carga, a pesar de que la situación se torna más difícil cada día, de acuerdo a Almánzar. Celso Marranzini, presidente de AIRD, explicó que no se tiene el número sobre el impacto económico porque es una situación cambiante que va fluyendo en la medida en que la situación cambia. Recordó que Haití depende del suministro de bienes básicos desde República Dominicana. Marranzini no cree que la alerta del presidente Luis Abinader a la población de no viajar a Haití afecte el intercambio comercial.El industrial apoyó el llamado de los presidentes dominicano, panameño y costarricense para que haya una intervención por parte de países desarrollado con el fin intervenir la crisis del país más pobre de Occidente. ""Todos queremos que Haití recupere la senda de la democracia y la estabilidad"" dijo Pedro Brache, presidente del Consejo Nacional de la Empresa Privada (Conep).Los empresarios esperan el respaldo de la comunidad internacional para empezar a revertir la crisis. Pará Marranzini, la situación es un peligro de seguridad nacional.","{

"Bundesbank: Wirtschaftswachstum 2021 schwächer als erwartet
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Die Wirtschaftsleistung werde ""wohl auch im Herbst ihr Vorkrisenniveau vom Schlussquartal 2019 noch verfehlen"", schreibt die Bundesbank in ihrem Monatsbericht Oktober. ""Im Jahr 2021 insgesamt dürfte das BIP deutlich weniger zulegen als in der Juni-Projektion der Bundesbank erwartet."" Im Juni hatte die Notenbank für das laufende Jahr einen Zuwachs des realen Bruttoinlandsprodukts (BIP) um 3,7 Prozent vorausgesagt.Doch Lieferengpässe und Materialknappheit bremsen den Aufschwung der Exportnation Deutschland. ""Im laufenden Quartal wird die gesamtwirtschaftliche Aktivität voraussichtlich deutlich schwächer zulegen"", schreiben die Volkswirte der Bundesbank in dem Monatsbericht. ""Der kräftige Schwung im Dienstleistungssektor dürfte erheblich nachlassen. (...) Das Verarbeitende Gewerbe dürfte weiter unter den Lieferschwierigkeiten leiden.""Im dritten Quartal profitierte beispielsweise das Gastgewerbe vom Zurückdrehen der Corona-Einschränkungen. ""Die deutsche Wirtschaft erholte sich im Sommer 2021 weiter"", bekräftigte die Bundesbank. ""Die wirtschaftliche Aktivität dürfte noch leicht stärker gestiegen sein als im Frühjahr."" Dass Lieferengpässe bei Rohstoffen und Vorprodukten die Produktion in der Industrie dämpften, habe ein noch stärkeres Wirtschaftswachstum im Sommer verhindert.Nach dem Einbruch der Wirtschaftsleistung im Corona-Lockdown zu Jahresbeginn (minus 2,0 Prozent) hatte das BIP im Zeitraum April bis einschließlich Juni 2021 zum Vorquartal zum 1,6 Prozent zugelegt. Erste Zahlen für das dritte Quartal will das Statistische Bundesamt an diesem Freitag (29.10.) veröffentlichen.","{

The Bundesbank expects a significant slowdown in economic activity in the current quarter, with the service sector's strong growth momentum likely to decline. The manufacturing industry will continue to struggle with production constraints.

"España descarta una estrategia de inmunización covid solo con vacunas ARNm
El Gobierno tiene previsto disponer de dos vacunas Covid-19 de al menos dos plataformas diferentes para completar las campañas de vacunación pendientes. El departamento dirigido por Carolina Darias considera que es ""la forma más segura de hacer hacer frente a posibles incertidumbres"" derivadas de la pandemia.  Siguiendo la estela de la mayoría de países de la Unión Europea (UE), la reserva vacunal de España contará así con 2 vacunas diferentes en los próximos meses, tal y como anunciaba el Ejecutivo en una respuesta parlamentaria. Lo que todavía se desconoce es qué dos tipos serán los elegidos por Sanidad para completar la administración e inocular las terceras dosis.  El organismo recuerda que la estrategia actual se basa, fundamentalmente, en las vacunas de ARNm, aunque reconoce que ""las vacunas basadas en proteínas tienen una larga tradición"", en referencia al fármaco desarrollado por Sanofi/GSK. Un anuncio que contrasta con la estrategia seguida a nivel europeo en la compra centralizada de vacunas centrada en aquellos fármacos de tipo ARNm, es decir, Moderna y Pfizer A principios de este mes, sin ir más lejos, el Ejecutivo revelaba su intención de compra de 3,8 millones de dosis de este último laboratorio.  ¿Qué inmunidad tiene la vacuna de Sanofi?  No obstante, el Gobierno tiene comprometidos varios lotes del tratamiento de Sanofi/GSK en sus previsiones de compra. En concreto, acordó la adquisición de 500.000 nuevas vacunas Vidprevtyn, de tecnología proteica, que serán entregadas durante el primer trimestre de 2022. Preguntado por la duración de su protección frente al contagio, el ministerio asegura que la vacuna sigue en estudio y, por lo tanto, ""no hay datos definitivos"".  En este sentido, el Grupo Parlamentario Vox, autor de la pregunta, critica que la adquisición de dicho lote se haya producido ""sin la previa y preceptiva autorización de comercialización y administración por parte de la Agencia Europea del Medicamento (EMA), ante lo cual, el ministerio aclara que se trata de una compra ""anticipada"" y ""tardía con respecto a las vacunas de Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca o Janssen"". ""Se ha considerado necesario al tratarse de una vacuna basada en proteínas recombinantes, que son vacunas clásicas y para las que existe mucha experiencia"", aclaraba el documento.  En cuanto a los ensayos, explica, que la Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (Aemps) está al tanto de todos ellos tanto a través de la autorización como del Steering Board que sigue la estrategia europea de vacunas. A la entrega de vacunas de Sanofi/GSK se sumará de forma anticipada el primer lote de dosis de Novavax a finales de 2021 y principios de 2022. Como parte asignada a España en el reparto de los primeros 20 millones de dosis comprometidas con la Unión Europea, las comunidades recibirán 679.972 dosis en noviembre de 2021, 810.850 en diciembre y 793.263 para enero de 2022. Fue a finales de agosto cuando el Consejo de Ministros aprobó la adquisición también adelantada de un total de 2.284.085 dosis de vacunas contra el coronavirus de Novavax. ","{
""reasoning"": ""The article discusses the Spanish government's plan to acquire two different COVID-19 vaccines, including one from Sanofi/GSK, which is based on protein technology. The government considers this strategy as 'the safest way to face possible uncertainties' derived from the pandemic. Although the majority of European countries have opted for mRNA-based vaccines like Moderna and Pfizer, Spain has chosen a different approach by acquiring vaccines from multiple platforms. This decision may be seen as a cautious move to ensure that there are alternative options available in case of any issues with the mRNA-based vaccines."",

One day, after staring at an academic paper for three hours and writing nothing, I went to an employment adviser. He sent me off in a whole new directionI expected to enjoy university, and when I didn't I was knocked sideways. I should have done: I was academic, I loved knowing things and equally, I had always thought I was gregarious, and liked having fun. I didn't think I was bad at making friends either. And indeed, I quickly found a small group of people I got on with. Yet despite all this, somehow I was plunged into a kind of despair I hadn't experienced before – and haven't been through since. I couldn't work it out then, and I can only speculate on it now.I suspect a lot of people thought it was all because of my blindness, but that's because if you have a disability, people like to attribute anything that goes wrong for you to that. In truth, I don't think it had much, if anything, to do with it. One possible explanation was the sheer size of the change in my circumstances. I had gone from an unusual, small and residential school, with just over 70 pupils, to a large, sprawling complex of colleges with about 10,000 students and staff. Everywhere you went was full of noise and bustle, and as everybody knows, you are nowhere more alone than in a crowd. Continue reading...","{

"「小明」賣舖上廣州？李家仁醫生2005年承繼灣仔地鋪 半世紀升值3,480萬
以一首《小明上廣州》成名的兒科醫生李家仁，最近售出灣仔有逾半世紀地舖，套現3,500萬元，物業於56年間大賺逾升值3,480萬元，期間升值逾178倍。賣舖事件令一眾網民憶起昔日其洗腦兒歌，笑言李家仁醫生是「被醫務耽誤的歌手」。 撰文：經一編輯部｜ 圖片：TVB《都市閒情》截圖、團結香港基金Youtube截圖 李家仁賣舖勁賺3,400萬 著名兒科醫生李家仁近年甚少參與兒歌演出，但李家仁卻於工商舖市場成功獲利。 李家仁上月以3,500萬元，售出其持有達56年的灣仔軒尼詩道地舖，物業約半世紀升值178倍。 地鋪原業主於1965年以19.5萬元購入物業，直至2005年，李家仁以遺產繼承人身份承繼地舖。若按是次成交價計，該地舖物業較56年前升值約3,480萬元，意味升值178倍。 土地註冊處資料顯示，由李家仁持有的灣仔軒尼詩道173號地鋪，於上月中成功沽售，成交價為3,500萬。新買家KIMERSON LIMITED以公司名義登記，註冊董事包括著名投資者施正懷等。 李家仁《小明上廣州》洗腦成名 李家仁早年主唱《小明上廣州》、《小明坐火車》等著名兒歌而令人熟悉。當年《小明上廣州》剛推出，3日內錄得30萬人次觀賞，歌曲更在電台派台。 近期李醫生亦於網上平台發布改編歌曲《小明抗疫歌》，藉此宣傳打疫活動，鼓勵市民接種新冠疫苗，延續其洗腦式風格，網民更笑言，李家仁醫生是「被醫務耽誤的歌手」。 《小明》系列部分作品 《小明上廣州》 《小明坐火車》 《小明去拜年》 《小明生日歌》 《小明去倫敦》 《小明遊深圳》 《小明探阿爺》..

"Mueren dos niños tras accidente en carrera automovilística
APKERRVILLE Un carro se descontroló y se estrelló contra la tribuna en medio de una carrera que se realizaba en la pista de un aeropuerto en Texas, matando a dos niños y dejando heridas a otras ocho personas, informaron autoridades. El suceso ocurrió el sábado en la tarde en la carrera apodada ""Airport Race Wars 2"" en el aeropuerto de Kerrville-Kerr County, informó la policía en un comunicado. Añadió que los menores fallecidos tenían 8 y 6 años de edad. Sus identidades no han sido divulgadas. El conductor ""perdió el control de su vehículo, estrellándose contra vehículos estacionados y contra los espectadores"", indicó la policía. Los heridos fueron llevados a distintos hospitales, entre ellos una mujer de 46 años en condición crítica. La mayoría de los demás heridos no están graves, aunque se desconocía la condición de un hombre de 26 años, afirmaron autoridades. Un niñito de 4 años y una bebé de 3 meses fueron llevados a un hospital para ser evaluados como precaución. El evento tuvo lugar a unos 97 kilómetros (60 millas) al noroeste de San Antonio. El website del Departamento de Visitantes de Kerrville había promovido el evento como ""un día de acción, para el disfrute de toda la familia"", en que los bólidos competirían para ganar 8.000 dólares en premios. Unas 3.500 personas asistían al evento, según Louis Amestoy, un periodista freelance que estaba entre los asistentes. La pista tenía unos 200 metros (0,8 millas) y estaba flanqueada por barriles llenos de agua para proteger al público. Pero Amestoy afirmó que no había barriles más allá de la meta final, por lo que los espectadores en ese último trecho estaban desprotegidos. Allí había espectadores a apenas unos 4 metros (15 pies) de distancia de la pista. Muchos habían traído sus propias sillas plegables a falta de lugar en las gradas. Los organizadores repetidamente pidieron al público mantenerse en el césped y alejados de la pista, contó Amestoy a The Associated Press en entrevista telefónica. El carro estaba casi al final de la pista cuando súbitamente se descontroló, narró Amestoy. cmb Contenidos Relacionados: Prisca Taruffi, la piloto que se rebeló y hace un nombre en automovilismoFallece Niki Lauda; leyenda del automovilismoMexicana de 15 años, promesa del automovilismo","{

"Noch viel Skepsis gegenüber möglichem digitalem Euro
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Allerdings gibt es auch noch viel Skepsis gegenüber dem von den Euro-Zentralbanken vorangetriebenen Projekt, wie aus der am Montag veröffentlichten Erhebung hervorgeht.Mehr als die Hälfte (56 Prozent) der Befragten gab demnach an, die Einführung eines digitalen Euro nicht zu befürworten. Allerdings weist die Bundesbank in ihrem Monatsbericht Oktober darauf hin, dass ""der Begriff des digitalen Euro in der breiten Öffentlichkeit zum Zeitpunkt der Befragung noch weitgehend unbekannt"" gewesen sei.Europas Währungshüter prüfen seit einer Weile die mögliche Einführung einer digitalen Variante der europäischen Gemeinschaftswährung. Mitte Juli 2021 beschloss die Europäische Zentralbank (EZB), die Vorarbeiten auf die nächste Stufe zu heben: In einer zweijährigen Untersuchungsphase geht es nun etwa um Technologie und Datenschutz. Ob ein digitaler Euro kommen wird, ist damit noch nicht entschieden.Skepsis gegenüber dem digitalen Euro""Insbesondere überzeugte Barzahler stehen dem digitalen Euro eher skeptisch gegenüber"", stellte die Bundesbank fest. Fast zwei Drittel (61 Prozent) derjenigen, die sich in der Umfrage ablehnend äußerten, befürchten, dass ein digitaler Euro der Einstieg in eine Abschaffung des Bargeldes wäre. Sowohl EZB als auch Bundesbank haben wiederholt versichert, ein digitaler Euro käme als Ergänzung zum Bargeld, nicht als Ersatz für Schein und Münze.Zu den wichtigsten Eigenschaften eines digitalen Euro gehören aus Sicht der Befragen eine einfache Nutzung, die Wahrung der Privatsphäre, Sicherheit in Bezug auf den Datenschutz und eine universelle Einsetzbarkeit. Für viele Befragte stelle ein digitaler Euro eine Chance dar, ""die kommerzielle Verwendung personenbezogener Daten durch privatwirtschaftliche Akteure zu vermeiden"", referierte die Bundesbank.Die Arbeiten an einem digitalen Euro sind eine Antwort der Euro-Zentralbanken auf den steilen Aufstieg von Kryptowährungen wie Bitcoin und Ether. Der große Unterschied: Im Gegensatz dazu stünde ein digitaler Euro unter Aufsicht einer Zentralbank, die die Stabilität der Währung sichert.","{

"Right food can help beat depression, say nutritionists
Hyderabad, October 26 Eating the right food can help beat depression effectively during difficult times, say nutritionists. Troubles linked to personal health, family situation, financial condition, and any other issue which might trigger despair during Covid-19 pandemic is likely to result in causing mental depression among those facing these situations. The common belief is that people when depressed tend to consume food in excess. However, nutritionists say eating the right food will also help people overcome depression. A Lancet report recently indicated that more and more people are suffering from depression related problems due to the after-effects of Covid-19 pandemic. Commenting on linkage between food and depression, Dr N. Malleshwari, Chief Dietician amp; Nutritionist, Gleneagles Global Hospital said: ""Poor food choices and selection of foods might contribute to deficiency of the nutrients which actually can result in depression. Some amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine are often helpful in treating many mild disorders including depression."" Mental depression is a serious problem that affects people around the world, and in many, this could be a life changing occurrence. ""While those who accept they are depressed, seek medical attention or counselling to overcome the condition, the best means to beat depression is to bring about lifestyle changes and start consuming a healthy diet. While medicines or counselling provide temporary relief, eating right food and bringing in positive lifestyle changes will help conquer the problem forever. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA amp; DHA) elicit anti-depressant effects among humans and are very important to be included in diet,"" said Malleshwari. ""Human bodies normally produce molecules which are called free radicals which could lead to cell damage resulting in quick ageing and cause other problems. Consuming antioxidants-rich foods and vitamins-rich fruits and vegetables will have a positive impact on the brain and certainly lessen the destructive effects of free radicals. Foods like carrots, pumpkin, spinach, oranges, tomato, nuts and seeds, will be of great help,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, Chief Dietitian, SLG Hospitals. Swetha, HoD - Nutrition, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital believes that eating small portions of proteins several times in a day will help boost energy in the human body and will clear the mind. ""Protein-rich tuna fish, turkey, chicken have amino acids which help the human body stay alert. Beans, peas, milk, soya, yogurt too are a good source of healthy proteins. People who are suffering from depression must ensure they do not consume alcohol, or smoke, and even cut down on caffeine intake to overcome the problem."" Overweight or obese people are more likely to suffer from depression because excess body weight will impact immune system and bring hormonal changes among both men and women. Obese individuals must immediately work on cutting down weight if they intend to overcome depression, and healthy food habits are a first step in that direction. Many people who are depressed also have problems with alcohol or drugs; and these not only can interfere with mood, sleep, and motivation, they can also reduce the effectiveness of depression medications. IANS","{

A kriptovilág szereplői hosszú évek óta várták már, hogy elindulhasson az első amerikai bitcoin ETF, amire végül múlt héten sor is került. Persze tudjuk, hogy ez határidős ETF és az igazi nagy dobás egy spot bitcoin alapú ETF lenne, de egyelőre arra még várni kell. Mindenesetre a bitcoin árfolyama a hype közepette új történelmi csúcsra került, pont az ETF indulásának napján, azonban nem mindenki van arról teljesen meggyőződve, hogy a rali az ETF indulásának hatására történt. A JP Morgan például amellett érvelt, hogy amit a bitcoin piacán láttunk az elmúlt hetekben-hónapokban, az sokkal inkább a kriptovaluta inflációs fedezeti eszközkénti mivoltából ered, sem mint az első amerikai ETF indulásából.","{

"Paypal verfolgt derzeit nicht den Kauf von Pinterest
San Jose (dpa) - Die Stellungnahme bestand nur aus einem Satz und ließ offen, ob die Verhandlungen von der plötzlichen Aufmerksamkeit gestört wurden oder die Medieninformationen nicht zutrafen.Der Kurs der Pinterest-Aktien war vergangene Woche nach den Berichten deutlich gestiegen. Am Mittwoch hatten unter anderem der Finanzdienst Bloomberg und das ""Wall Street Journal"" berichtet, Paypal sei in Übernahmeverhandlungen mit Pinterest. Nach Bloomberg-Angaben war dabei ein Preis von 70 Dollar pro Aktie im Gespräch gewesen - das wäre ein Aufschlag von rund einem Viertel auf den vorherigen Schlusskurs. Die Aktie stieg daraufhin um bis zu 13 Prozent.Pinterest fing an als Ort, an dem Nutzer Fotos aus dem Netz auf sogenannten Pinboards zu bestimmten Themen speichern können - zum Beispiel, wenn sie einen Urlaub planen oder ihr Zuhause umgestalten wollen. Inzwischen versteht sich Pinterest zudem als eine visuelle Suchmaschine, in der Software ähnliche Objekte identifizieren kann. Auf Basis dieser Fähigkeit will der Dienst auch verstärkt eine Rolle im Online-Handel spielen - so dass man die Dinge, die man sieht, auch gleich kaufen könnte. Hier könnte ein Ansatzpunkt für Paypal liegen.Paypal kommt derzeit auch durch den Boom beim Online-Shopping in der Corona-Pandemie auf eine Marktkapitalisierung von 320 Milliarden Dollar. Der Dienst war einst Teil der Online-Handelsplattform Ebay.Pinterest gehörte im vergangenen Jahr zu den Gewinnern der Corona-Pandemie: Mehr Menschen nutzten die Lockdown-Zeit für die App. Mit dem Abbau der Corona-Beschränkungen sank die Nutzerzahl zu Beginn des Sommers wieder.

"Deutschland verfehlt Sammelziel bei Elektroschrott
Dessau-Roßlau (dpa) - Insgesamt wurden 947.067 Tonnen Elektroaltgeräte von den Kommunen, Händlern und Herstellern in Deutschland eingesammelt, wie eine Auswertung des UBA ergab. Dies entspreche einer Sammelquote von 44,3 Prozent. Das seit 2019 in allen EU-Ländern geltende Mindestsammelziel von 65 Prozent sei damit deutlich verfehlt worden.Besserung erhofft sich das Umweltbundesamt durch das novellierte Elektro- und Elektronikgerätegesetz (ElektroG), das 2022 in Kraft tritt. ""Die Änderungen sind ein wichtiger Schritt. Zum Beispiel sollen ab dem 1. Juli 2022 auch Lebensmitteldiscounter Elektroaltgeräte zurücknehmen – so kann die Altgeräteentsorgung verbrauchernah und gleich mit dem Wocheneinkauf erledigt werden"", sagte UBA-Präsident Dirk Messner.Handel, Hersteller sowie Kommunen müssten sich stärker einbringen und Sammel- und Rücknahmemöglichkeiten weiter verbessern, beispielsweise durch besser erreichbare Wertstoffhöfe oder flexiblere Annahmezeiten, verlangte er: ""Immer noch werden zu viele Altgeräte abseits der korrekten Pfade entsorgt.""Wichtig sei außerdem eine bessere Information der Verbraucher. ""Immer noch werden zu viele Altgeräte nicht korrekt entsorgt: So landen kleine Altgeräte wie elektrische Zahnbürsten oder Wecker noch häufig im Restmüll oder werden bei den Verpackungsabfällen entsorgt. Oder sie bleiben unentsorgt in Schubläden und Kellern liegen"", klagte das Umweltbundesamt. Gleichzeitig nehme die Menge an neuen Elektrogeräten stetig und deutlich zu.","{

The Umweltbundesamt (UBA) expects improvement through the revised Elektro- und Elektronikgerätegesetz (ElektroG), which will come into effect in 2022. However, the article highlights that more needs to be done by industry, manufacturers, and municipalities to improve collection and take-back options, as well as inform consumers better about proper waste disposal. The sentiment is neutral, but leaning slightly towards negative due to the failure to meet the target."",

"Leading business for the common good
Two of the country's leading institutions for business management education joined forces to stage the ""Leading Business for the Common Good"" webinar last October 22, 2021. This was in consonance with the Covenant for Shared Prosperity launched by the Management Association of the Philippines in November 2020. The latter is a sobering imperative for businesses to rethink their business models in terms of stakeholder stewardship above that of shareholder primacy.To showcase covenants in action, influential business leaders and academicians were invited to lend their wisdom and real-world experience. For Covenant No. 5, to ""protect and preserve the environment ... by employing environment friendly technologies"", First Philippine Holdings Chairman and CEO Federico Lopez recounted how they steered their companies towards the new vision of committing to ""forging collaborative pathways for a decarbonized and regenerative future"" through deliberate and judicious investments in renewable energy.In illustrating Covenant No. 4, to ""be actively involved in communities ... with particular attention to the needs of the disadvantaged"", former Public Works Secretary Babes Singson directed us, especially the youth, to mind the bottom 40 percent of society. At the same time, he called on companies big and small to operationalize at least three to five UN Sustainable Development Goals when defining their own critical environmental, social, and corporate governance factors.Human resource consultant and DLSU senior lecturer Ramon Segismundo emphasized Covenant No. 3 and No. 6. These relate to the fair treatment of a company's non-controlling stakeholders such as employees via business processes that safeguard health and enable productivity. Meanwhile Ben Teehankee, DLSU professor of business ethics, highlighted Covenant No. 1 and No. 2, which encourage meritocracy in employment and providing products and services that are of value to the consumer in true observance of humanistic management principles.Despite the robust economic growth of recent years, gnawing inequality and poverty should be a call to arms to find solutions that realize win-win scenarios. Remaining mired in the old paradigms of profit maximization have unknowingly caused the urgent existential crises that we face today.With ""Leading Business for Common Good"", the ultimate aim was to galvanize the academe-business sector towards embedding practices of the covenants into the Philippine business ecosystem. In so doing, embolden us to seek innovative ways that necessarily serve both the business and social goals. As the country is entering into a pivotal election year, we need to exercise active citizenship by choosing the ""right"" leaders who equally walk the talk.We highly encourage everyone to watch the recorded event on: https://fb.watch/8PkluD7L-g/.Geraldine ""Dina"" Go-Bernardo is a lecturer of strategic management and sport management at De La Salle University's Ramon Del V. Rosario College of Business. She is also a research associate of the Business for Human Development Network. The views expressed above are the author's and do not necessarily reflect the official position of De La Salle University and its faculty and administrators.","{
